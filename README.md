# Easel
## Easel is a prototype cross-platform mobile application that provides a marketplace for artists and art consumers to buy and sell original art in an environment designed to be free of generative AI.

I built Easel as my final project for my computer science MSc at the University of Bristol. I designed the platform based on research of the current relationship between generative AI and art and iterativley evaluated the design and feautures through user testing, including a final evaluation with a group of artists.
